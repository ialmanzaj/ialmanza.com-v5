# Active Context: Website Optimization - Meta & Tag Hygiene

## 1. Current Focus
- Next task in "Meta & Tag Hygiene": "Shorten any meta descriptions over 160 characters".

## 2. Recent Changes
- Addressed "Add unique `<title>` and `<meta description>` to all pages":
  - Confirmed `app/page.tsx` (homepage) inherits title/description from `app/layout.tsx`.
  - Added a unique `metadata` export (title and description) to `app/blog/high-agency/page.mdx`.
- Updated `progress.md`.

## 3. Next Steps
- Check the length of current meta descriptions:
  - Root layout (`app/layout.tsx`): "Isaac Almanza: Tech entrepreneur building innovative web applications and scaling digital businesses. Expertise in software development, product strategy, and bringing ideas to market."
  - Blog post (`app/blog/high-agency/page.mdx`): "Exploring the concept of high agency: what it means to be unstoppable, create your own reality, and get things done regardless of circumstances."
- Shorten them if they exceed 160 characters.
- The 404 link task is still pending.
- The ESLint issue in `animated-background.tsx` is pending manual review.
- The sitemap submission to Google Search Console is a manual step for Isaac to complete.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations
- For now, assuming the identified pages (`/` and `/blog/high-agency`) are the only ones requiring unique metadata. New pages will need attention.
- The homepage metadata can be further refined later if desired for more specificity.

## 5. Memory Bank Update
- Memory Bank updated (May 2025) to include Isaac Almanza's expanded personal and professional background, major fintech accomplishments, interests, and co-founder search criteria.
- Website About and relevant sections should be updated to reflect this richer context and narrative.
